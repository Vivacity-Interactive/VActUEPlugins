# VActML
This is still work in progress, attempt to bring more native ML to unreal engine, independed of too many external frameworks and packages for runtime use. earliest focuses will be by order. [VActML](VActML/README.md)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Proximal Policy Optimization 2 (PPO2)
- Continuous K-Nearest Neighbour (CKNN) 
- Large Language Model (LLM) Minimal Base Implementation

_will also attempt to focus on including compute shader versions of algorithms, maybe tensor shader if internally accessible by unreal engine, or abusing other shaders that may be isomorphic in behaviour_
