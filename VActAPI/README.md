## VActAPI
Allows for running server like behaviour (an aip-route-service) on your game instance on a local network, allows for direction connection like uploading images or other assets, or simply to communcate, allowing `Blueprint` extension on callbacks. [VActAPI](VActAPI/README.md)

_Unfortunately, still, due to the strange nature of its singleton behaviour, the API does not work well with PIE, so testing can only work at first startup, a re run of PIE or compilation will break the references_
